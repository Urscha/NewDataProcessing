	<h2>Steps of the design process</h2>
	<div class="storytelling">
		<ul>
			<li>Fist step in the design process was to design the page. I decided to put the title at the top and change the font. Below that 
			i decided to put both graphs. I decided to put them below each other because in that way, the choropleth could be big enough to still
			see the smaller countries. </li>
			<li>When I designed the choropleth, I used the color brewer to get 5 sequential colors because the data of the GDP is sequential. When I first
			made the choropleth, I made took the maximum and minimum value of the GDP per country and divided it by 5 to get the groups. But then most countries 
			fell in the first two groups. Therefore I changed the range for the data groups so that the countries were more evenly divided over the 'colors'.</li>
			<li>I also added a legend to the choropleth, since that is important to understand the data. I also added tooltips while hovering over a country to 
			enable the users to see exactly what GDP per capita each country has.</li>
			<li>After designing the choropleth, I made the scatterplot. In order to reduce data-ink ratio, I made a basic scatterplot. I choose black for the 
			color of the dots, but the highlighted dots are red, to stick to the color scheme of the choropleth. I made the dots not too big and not too small 
			because you have to be able to hover over them (to show the tooltip) but if they are too big, the highlighted doesn't stand out as much.</li>
			<li>At the bottom of the page I added some text to explain the visualisations, as well as the links to the data sources I used. </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Interaction design</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The interaction I used is that when you click on a country in the choropleth, the dot in the scatterplot of that country is highlighted. In that way
			you can see how that country is located when looking at GDP per country compared to other countries in the world and also how the inhabitants of that country
			rate their happiness. So when the country is clicked, the style of the dot that was clicked before is changed back to black and the current
			country becomes red.</li>
		</ul>
