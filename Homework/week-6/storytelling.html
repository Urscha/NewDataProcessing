	<h1>Storytelling</h1>
	<h2>How does happiness relate to GDP per capita?</h2>
		<div class="storytelling">
			<p>Does money make people more happy? That is a question that everyone (or a lot of people) would like to know the answer to.
			I wanted to tell the story of the relationship between happiness and GPD and if it is true, that people that live in more 'wealthy' countries
			in de the world, are happier compared to people who live in poorer countries. </p><p>With my visualisations, I first show the world-map including GPD
			per capita for most of the countries in the world. This is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year, 
			converted at market exchange rates to current U.S. dollars, divided by the average (or mid-year) population for the same year.
			However, it does not take cost of living into account per country. So these figures can give a rough estimation of the standard
			of living for each country, but it is not a measure of personal income.
			</p>
			<p>Then, in my second visualisation, I show the happiness score for most countries of the world. Here, life evaluation was measured by the 
			individual answers to the Cantril ladder question: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. 
			The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. 
			On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”. 
			</p>
			<p>If you look at the scatterplot, you can see there is a positive linear relationship between GDP per capita and happiness. Therefore,
			I think I made the point, with these visualisations, that living in a more wealthy countrie, does increase your happiness.</p>

			<h2>Functionality</h2>
			<p>I wanted it to be easy for a user to have a country in mind and see the GDP per capita for that country and where the 'happiness' of that country is located. 
			Therefore I made an interactive map where you can hover over a country to see the exact GDP per capita and when you click on that country, it shows where
			the country is located when it comes to happiness (in the scatterplot).</p>
			<h2>Storytelling genre</h2>
			<p>The genre that I used for my story was the 'annotated chart'. </p>
